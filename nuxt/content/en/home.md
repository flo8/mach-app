Our mission? Train **10,000** software engineers in Japan üóæ

#description
The world is changing rapidly and software is reshaping the economy and companies all over the world, including Japan. While most companies understand the importance of digital technologies, tech talent is *really* hard to find. For this reason, many companies are ready to pay high salaries, hire foreigners or offer remote work positions.

Most tech startups do not care about your diploma, school name, your age or gender. Skills and your ability to get the job done effectively are all that matters.

I started this project because I hired a lot of people over the past few years. Believe me, the school name never mattered much to me. Actually, many of the people who impressed me the most by their skills, were self taught who never attended university.

I believe it is urgent to train more people in Japan. Of course, there are many great universities, however not everyone had the chance to enter or afford them. Or they simply didn't choose this way when it as time to choose.

When it comes education, constraints such as money or location shouldn't be issues. We believe a different approach is possible.

**We are on a mission to train the software engineers of tomorrow and we are just getting started.**
