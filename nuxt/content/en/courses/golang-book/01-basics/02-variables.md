# Using variables

<Compiler >

```go
package main

import "fmt";

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello, number 2")
}
```

</Compiler>

With variables, we can remember values and later refer to them via named references. using variables will make our code easier to read.

## Introduction

In this lesson we'll cover:

- The usage of variables in Go.
- How to create them.
- Assign different types and values.

## Declare variables

In Go, there are many ways to declare variables:

- **Define a name and type**. Here, you declare a variable with the keyword `var`, give it a name and lastly a type `string`. Below is an example:

  ```go
  var firstName string
  ```

- **Define a group** of variables. It's possible to define a group of variables. Using this way of declaring means you only type the `var` keyword once. The group is defined using parenthesis `()`:

  ```go
  var (
    firstName = "Chris"
    age = 20
  )
  ```

  Note how each variable is on a new row.

- **Define and assign a value**. Within functions, you can use the `:=` operator, it declares and assigns at the same time. The below code shows the creation of the `firstName` variable. The data type is inferred to be a string:

  ```go
  firstName := "Chris"
  ```

## Assign variables

To assign a new value to a variable, it needs to exist first. You use the assignment operator, `=`. Here's an example:

```go
firstName = "Mike"
```

## Data types

There are many data types you can use with Go. They are divided into different categories:

- **Basic types**. In this category, we find types like integers, floats (numbers with decimals) and other types like Booleans (for true/false), strings (for text) and more.
- **Composite types**. We will talk about composite types in a separate article, but they are more complex, and examples of composite types are arrays, structs and interfaces.

### Declare a variable with a type

There are two ways you can declare a variable and give it a type:

- **explicitly**, by specifying its type, for example:

  ```go
  var name string
  ```

- **implicitly**, by assigning it a value and having it been inferred:

  ```go
  name := "chris"
  ```

  In the preceding code, the data type is inferred by the value you give it. In this case, the data type becomes `string` based on the value "chris".

## String interpolation

Sometimes, you want to be able to write things to the screen and mix different data types doing so. For example, you might want to write, "Customer: Adam has 20$ in his bank account".

Let's say then that this information is represented by these two variables:

```go
var (
  customerName = "Adam"
  accountBalance = 20
)
```

How can you print out the text above? For this purpose, you can use the `Printf()` function that takes formatters. The idea is that a formatter is an instruction to what a certain type is. By providing this information to `Printf()`, it's able to print the type correctly.

Here's how you can print the example string from before:

```go
fmt.Printf("Customer %s has %d$ on their bank account", customerName, accountBalance)
```

Above, the `%s` represents a string and `%d` represents a number. By using these formatters as placeholders, the variables are correctly implemented, and the output becomes:

```
Customer Adam has 20$ on their bank account
```

## Assignment - define some variables and print them out

Define some variables you might need for the card game Texas Holdem and print them out.

Create a file _main.go_ and give it the following content:

```go
 package main

 import "fmt"

 func main () {
 }
```

1. Add the following variables after the import section:

   ```go
   var (
     players = 3
     replay = false
     namePlayerOne = "chris"
   )
   ```

   Now you have:

   - `players`, to represent the number of players in the game.
   - `replay`, a boolean stating whether to start a new game session when the old one has ended.
   - `namePlayerOne`, a string representing the name of the first player.

   All of these variables help describe essential information in a Texas Holdem game.

   Next, let's run our app to make sure it works.

1. Add the following code to the `main()` function to print out the variables:

   ```go
   fmt.Println(players)
   fmt.Println(replay)
   fmt.Println(namePlayerOne)
   ```

1. Run `go run main.go` in the terminal:

   ```go
   go run main.go
   ```

   You should see the following output:

   ```
    3
    false
    chris
   ```

   Great, you now have a starting point for an app you can keep building on.

## ðŸš€ Challenge

See if you can come up with more variables to represent the state in a Texas Holdem card game, like for example, other players, the card deck etc. What data type would you give those variables?

## Review & Self Study

Have a look at this [official tutorial on variables](https://go.dev/tour/basics/8) using a Go sandbox

## Solution

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var (
  players = 3
  replay = false
  namePlayerOne = "chris"
)

func main () {
  fmt.Println(players)
  fmt.Println(replay)
  fmt.Println(namePlayerOne)
}
```
