  Beyond trying to achieve the best online learning experience. We are working hard on this one to deliver a great first version of our online learning platform starting 2023. We also expect this to be a never ending product that we will keep improving over time with your feedbacks.

  So, this is just the beginning of a long journey. Here are a few random thoughts about how we could make this place 10x better in the future.
</div>

## 1. Build communities

Being able to learn from anywhere at any time is clearly great. Yet, we also think that building communities should be one of our priorities for the coming years. The power of the network effect is real. Even in the future, when searching for new work opportunities or creating your dream startup, we're stronger together. A network of people always ready to help is actually what makes a lot of people pay for very expensive universities.

We humans, are social beings. A lot of magic happens when we meet like-minded people, they can encourage us when we are down and vice versa. Having a sense of belonging to a community is also a strong incentive to keep going when we feel giving up. Not feeling alone, being helped, sharing our difficulties, are a big part of the learning experience.

For this reason, we are considering to create online communities using chap apps or forum kind of software. That said, they also have their limits, which brings us to the next point in our roadmap.

## 2. Mixing online and offline experience

Communities can be online and yet very strong. Yet, I also do believe that the strongest human bonds are created in real life. Online has its limits.

Offline learning experience can provide great advantages.

1. **More focus.** It is easier to get distracted by our daily lives when learning online. Isolating ourselves can create magic when it comes to learning. It also provides a great moment to reflect on our lives, who we are and who do we want to be?
2. **Greater life quality.** Let's be real. Living in big cities can be expensive. Many villages in Japan are stunningly beautiful and almost deserted, especially from the youth. These places could provide a great place with an affordable and great quality of life, allowing students to focus 100% on their learning. The ability to spend time together, discuss project ideas, make new friends. No online experience can replace this.
3. **Save of time.** Commuting in big cities can be useful if you take advantage of this time to invest in yourself. Yet, it's never as good as having zero commutation time. Being able to wake up, enjoy fresh air, spend your time learning, enjoy great food and go back to your studies in a great environment. This gives you a productivity boost that is hard to beat.
4. **Socializing.** When a group of people face the same difficulties and work hard together to overcome these, the strongest bonds are created. A lot of the learning can take place outside of the learning time. Sharing with your friends what you learnt or exchange questions is a very valuable part of the learning experience.
5. **Being human again.** Walking barefoot in grass, being surrounded with nature makes us happier, more productive, reduces stress and as a result improves learning. It's also reconnect us to things that make us feel and be humans.

### Ok nice, concretely what would this look like? ü§î

While it is true that most of the work is in big cities, why study in a place that is crowded with expensive with long commuting time?

On the top of this, having to pay a rent means you need to keep a day job to afford your rent. Having the option to move to a place where the rent is very low with access to locally produced food, means not only people could quit their day jobs to focus on their studies for a few months. This would greatly accelerate their learnings in both quantity of time and also quality of focus.

A lot of villages are deserted in Japan. These place often have peaceful environment, cheap to free places to rent, great landscapes, delicious food, is there a better learning environment?

And what better way to develop a sense of togetherness and social awareness than to actually live together? Connecting with new people & socializing are skills than make us better humans. Struggling together makes us more resilient, less prone to give up and also creates strong bonds with like-minded people.

This would be a win-win situation ü§ù

1. üóæ Benefit rural economies with a positive economical and social impact üí¥
2. üßò Create affordable environment for people to come and focus on studies üçµ

While some people may prefer an experience 100% online, the offline experience should be also an option on the table for those who want. Even better, the ability to do some part of your learning online and also to visit some places where people gather to learn together, would be the best of both worlds.

Of course, for this to succeed, we would need to establish clear rules and a proper code of conduct. Yet, this idea is a very interesting one we would like to pursue in the future.

## 3. Help our students with career advice

Wether you are looking for your first internship, have a great startup idea or want to find a job. This platform could be a great place to connect students and companies.

We have high expectations for our future students and a positive image of our curriculum would be a great way to attract companies to hire our students.

## 4. Computer lending service

Not everyone can afford a computer. While it is very easy to get second hand computer for coding with a very low budget. There are also a lot of computers unused by companies.

Unlike what people believe, programming does not require a modern / high-end computer. Actually, old computers who can just access internet are largely sufficient.

As it is now possible to learn and practice software engineering right from inside a browser, any computer that can access Internet is largely sufficient. No need to get the latest or a fancy Macbook to get started.

For people who still can't afford this, we could partner with companies to collect unused machines and recycle them into learning computers.

## 5. Invest in the future: Kids.

Kids will be the future adults who will create the companies of tomorrow. There is nothing more important than to invest in them and prepare them for the digital economy.

Many parents think giving a computer or an iPad is enough, it's not. These tools usually transform kids into users, not creators.

Even worse, many studies show that social media such as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram or Youtube are destroying the attention span, imagination, capacity to focus and creativity.

I believe scarcity forces imagination. I learnt coding with a computer that had no games, just a book to learn how to write games and a very rudimentary terminal. It was far from convenient but it was a great teacher of patience. Having to build my own games before I could play them was what got me started with programming.

## 6. Help orphanages

There are close to 40000 kids living in orphanages today in Japan as you read this. Many of these kids have not had an easy start in life, obviously.

Not having a family and parents to support you and pay for higher education is something that can't be fixed or replaced. However, bringing a little more support is something we would like to do.

Giving these kids access to computers and programming lessons would give them a chance to create a better future for themselves.

These are just a few random ideas. Ideas are cheap, executing them smoothly is the hard part. In any case, we can all witness that the world is undergoing very profound changes and they are accelerating. I also believe new challenges mean new ways of thinking and new solutions. The ideas above might seem unconventional and a bit strange, good, that's where we are heading.
