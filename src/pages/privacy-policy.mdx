## Overview

Mach10 is an online platform designed to help you learn new skills with a focus on coding skills through practice and mentorship. The platform is located at www.mach10.jp (and associated subdomains).

Mach10 is an open source project to provide an online platform for you to develop your software coding skills.

Our approach to your privacy is very straightforward to understand.

1. We do not collect more personal information than we need
2. We will not share any data you give us (e.g. your email address) with other third parties
3. We try to give you as much control about what information you share. For instance, we offer facilities to have an anonymous handle/user name if you want, and we don't require you to create a public profile.

## Information collected during account registration

During registration we collect some information about you, such as your name and email address.

During sign-up you will also be asked to create a **username**. There is no requirement for your **username** to be personally identifiable.

We use your name and email to send you notifications and updates (if you choose receive them) and any important notices.

## Information we collect while you use our online Services

We may collect usage information about your use of our Service, such as the number of problems you have attempted, statistics on your progress in the courses, and the amount of time spent to complete a course or an exercise. This enables us to better tailor educational experiences that are most appropriate for you.



## Cookies

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit.

We only use first-party cookies, which are cookies that we control. We only use strictly necessary, functional cookies, e.g. for managing your signed-in session to our website(s). We do **not** use first-party cookies for external tracking purposes (such as analytics).

We do **not** use third-party cookies. Other cookies may be set when you sign in through a third Party (such as GitHub).

## How we use the information we've collected

All the information we collect is made to understand and improve the platform. In order to improve Mach10, we may use the data we collect to improve the courses content. This may include performing data analysis on anonymized datasets.

## Sharing and transferring data

We do not rent or sell any Personal Information and never will. Period.

If you choose to publish personal information on our Platform (such as, for instance, your name on a public profile page), you will remain responsible and in control of that information. You should *NOT* include personal information in your code solutions or feedback comments.
