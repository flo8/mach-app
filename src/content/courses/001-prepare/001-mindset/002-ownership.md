As we saw in the previous section, removing limiting beliefs is a key part of your own success.

So next question becomes, how to remove these beliefs? Ownership or even “Extreme ownership” is the practice of feeling responsible for everything in your world, to an extreme degree.

Being responsible means identifying the real root cause of problems which usually leads to you. While this might sound scary to make you believe that everything is your responsibility, it also turns you into someone who is an actor of the situation, not suffering from it.

Let’s take some concrete examples.

| No ownership                                                        | Ownership mindset                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I couldn’t swim, the water was too cold for me.                     | I am not prepared enough for swimming in cold water, I need to practice more so I could swim anywhere I want, whatever the temperature.                                  |
| I lost money on the stock market because this economy is too bad.   | I didn’t educate myself well on how to invest during bad economical situations and lost money, I need to learn more about risk management so it doesn’t happen again.    |
| I was really bad at math so I didn’t get good grades.               | I didn’t study math enough so my grades were not good.                                                                                                                   |
| I am late today because of the traffic.                             | I am late as I didn’t anticipate that traffic can be worse than usual sometimes, I will take some safety margin from now on so it doesn’t happen again.                  |
| My company fired me because they couldn’t see the value of my work. | My company fired me because I failed to show and make them understand the value I actually contributed to the company.                                                   |
| I got a bad employee in my team.                                    | I did a poor job at screening the right candidate for this position, I am also failing at making this employee improve. I need to improve in both of these areas.        |
| My boyfriend doesn’t understand me                                  | I should improve at explaining how I feel and make my expectations more clear. If I feel this doesn’t work, I will need to move on and and find someone I get along with |

See the difference? Yes everything can seem you are blaming everything on yourself. However, all these observations are useful for your growth. As long as you blame others, weather or anything beyond your control, you are missing an opportunity to learn & grow into a more resilient, better, stronger person. If you feel and think that way, you will never, ever feel like a victim. Don’t ever be a victim of external events. We can always take responsibility of what is going on.

So how does it applies to us here and now? Well, the same examples above can be applied in your own context now.

| No ownership                                                            | Extreme ownership                                                                                                                      | Notes                                                                                                                                                                            |

| I have no time for this course because I’m so busy with my current work | I have no time for this course, how can I free up 2 hours in my week from other activities so I can spend these 2 hours on this course | Somewhere in the world, I am sure there is someone who is busier than you and who still manages to keep her schedule to learn                                                    |
| I am not someone who has a lot of motivation, I am usually lazy         | My motivation is clearly lacking, to compensate, I will set a weekly schedule that I will stick to for at least the next month         | Motivation is not something that just happens miraculously to some people by chance. Taking action creates motivation. And discipline can go places that motivation alone can’t. |

It might seem like constantly owning more than your “fair share” of blame could feel defeating or even depressing. But I have found the opposite to be true. Acknowledgement and acceptance of a failure can help you truly understand the root cause. Accepting that honest reality is the first step toward figuring out a solution. Those around you hear: I own the responsibility for what happened, I know why and how it happened, and I have a plan to fix it.

When you take Extreme Ownership, you put yourself in a position of control instead of suffering from a situation. This can be applied in all areas of your life. Whether it’s your love life, work or studies this can be applied to every areas of our life. Don’t be passive, be a proactive and positive agent of change. Your life will become easier and also more interesting.
