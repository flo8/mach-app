### Limitating beliefs

What determines our choices and ultimately our direction in life? Why do some remain optimistic and motivated and others give up when faced with difficulties? Why do some students think they suck? Here is the danger of limiting beliefs.

We all know that we can either be a person who creates our lives or a mere creature who is subject to the circumstances of our lives. The difference between the two lies in your ability to realize that you create your life on the one hand and that your life is the result of your own beliefs on the other.

One might think that I am exaggerating when I say that your life is the result of your beliefs. Let me explain further.

**What is a belief?**
A belief is a generalized idea that you deduce from the different events that mark your life. This belief becomes a basic principle that will guide all your choices and decisions throughout your life. These beliefs are dangerous because they do their work unconsciously.

For example, a child who is criticized often by his parents may interpret this series of criticisms as not measuring up or that he will never be able to succeed in life. The child may not think this explicitly. In other words, he will not verbalize in his head that he does not measure up. But this idea will form in his mind and will be present every time he is faced with a difficult situation. This is why these ideas are called beliefs.

It is also a belief because it is never 100% true. In the previous paragraph, I used the word "interpretation". A belief is a kind of unconscious explanation that you give to a situation or an event and that is not necessarily the best or the most useful. Logically, being criticized by parents does not only mean that we are not up to the task.

It would mean that we are very good and that our parents want us to stay that way. It could also mean that we have great potential that our parents want to bring out. In short, there are many other more positive interpretations that could constitute motivating beliefs.

**Limiting beliefs**
There are motivating beliefs and limiting beliefs. In my example above, this is obviously a limiting belief. The fact that I end up believing that I am not up to the task will lead to low self-esteem and thus an inability to face life's challenges. There are several common limiting beliefs that are very important to discover:

- I suck
- I can't learn quickly
- I am not important
- others don't like me
- I can't handle difficult situations
- I can't face my boss
- I can't say what I think
- I could never succeed because of my family background
- you have to be rich to succeed

Discovering your limiting beliefs is very important even if it does not allow you to eliminate them alone. But it is a first step. It is not always easy to find a limiting belief because they are often unconscious, especially when you are already doing this work on yourself. But once you are faced with an obstacle, it is obvious that the limiting belief is somewhere in your head and it is the one that prevents you from moving forward.

**The rosenthal / pygmalion effect**

The following story begins in a school, the Oak School in San Francisco in the 1960s.

Leonore Jacobson was the headmistress and was very interested in child psychology. She asked Robert Rosenthal, a psychologist from the University of California at Riverside, to conduct an experiment with her students to study an intuition: the self-fulfilling prophecy.

To a first group of teachers, Robert Rosenthal and Leonore Jacobson told them that some of their students had been identified as having the potential to become high achievers and that these students would flourish over the course of the year.

In fact, these students were nothing special and chosen totally randomly.

However, when the results were assessed at the end of the school year, Robert Rosenthal and Léonore Jacobson found that the selected children had, on average, made much more progress and were learning much better than their peers.

This has also been observed particularly in parenting. If parents choose to treat their children as intelligent, talented, and independent human beings, according to the Pygmalion effect, numerous studies show that these kids are more likely to internalize these attitudes and act accordingly.

This is also true in companies, when team members are shown positive expectations about their abilities and performance, for example by believing that they can solve a difficult problem, their performance significantly improves.

These experiments were repeated in different countries and different situations and all lead to the same conclusion. So what is the conclusion here? There is no magic here, when people have more self confidence, their performance and results increase.

The good news is that this self confidence is something you can create for yourself. You can be your biggest supporter and convince yourself that you can do it, or you can keep convincing you that it is too hard for you.

A famous Henry Ford quote, “_Whether you think you can, or you think you can't – you're right_” emphasizes how much attitude determines success or failure.

Margaret Thatcher famously said _“Watch your thoughts, for they become words. Watch your words, for they become actions. Watch your actions, for they become habits. Watch your habits, for they become your character. And watch your character, for it becomes your destiny. What we think, we become.”_

### How should you feel about difficulty?

Is it normal for a beginner to fall off a bike a couple times? Is it normal for a beginner to sink a couple times when learning to swim? Is it normal for a beginner to miss notes or play the wrong notes when learning an instrument? Is it normal for a beginner to burn some meals? Is it normal for a beginner to struggle to complete their reps when working out at a gym?

**Absolutely yes!**

Failure and struggle are natural parts of the learning process. Failure teaches you how to *not do things* and gives you valuable feedback on how well you understand something. Failure is just another word for *gained experience*.

Failing and struggling is something every beginner goes through: you're *supposed* to struggle. So instead of feeling discouraged, you should embrace this: struggle is a sign that you're challenging yourself. Use it as a guide to help you figure out what material you need to review and learn next, or what questions you should be asking.

Even experts fail and struggle when they need to learn new material (though they tend to be better at recovering/using failure as a way to help them accelerate their learning).

In fact, if you *aren't* struggling, that's a sign that you're almost certainly doing something wrong. If everything is easy, that means that:

1. You're not challenging yourself
2. You're not pushing yourself to learn something genuinely new
3. You're not forcing yourself to really make sure you understand the material by trying to apply it

It's similar to exercising. If you don't feel physically tired after a workout, did you really gain much out of the exercise? Similarly, if you don't feel mentally tired or mentally challenged after working on some coding challenges, did you really learn anything?

**How can I get/stay motivated to learn programming?**

Often we think "if I were motivated enough... then I could...," however; it is action that drives motivation. First comes action, then motivation. Find small, specific programs to create that seem fun and entertaining to you.

Get rid of the distractions. Go offline from time to time. Motivation is not something that comes by chance, it’s usually the result of the will to take action and then enjoying it more and more.

Discipline will take you to places that motivation alone can’t.
