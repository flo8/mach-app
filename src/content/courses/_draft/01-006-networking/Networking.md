### Networking concepts

How Internet works in general (thanks to RFC!!!)

Implement a simple SOCKS5 proxy + use MermaidJS to explain what is going on

what’s a socket?

what is an IP

what is a port?

what is binding? listening?

OSI model

tcp vs udp

[localhost](http://localhost) / 127.0.0.1

Your first ping and how to read / interpret it? What’s RTT? Why does it matters?

—— Why HTTPS (secure) makes website slower? (SSL handshake, etc)

Content Delivery Networks

— How a CDN work (conceptually)?

— Average loading times / network speed / what makes things slow

Focus on HTTP

— HTTP protocol : what are body/headers

— Average loading times / network speed / what makes things slow

—  protocol : knowing different headers

—— Cookies header

—— Last-Modified, ETag, ...
