# Startup creation

First and foremost, my advice to get started: Go for B2B, B2C sounds more glamorous but the death rate for companies in this space is very high. It also requires more capital, building a user base (cold start problem) is capital intensive. Building the next Instagram might sound sexy but it’s terribly difficult and odds of success are thin. My advice is to start with B2B for your first company at least. How to start a B2B business?

I love Sahil Lavingia's approach to creating companies.

1. Start with a community you want to help.
2. Identify a problem in their lives.
3. Build a product or service to solve it.

### Why B2B is usually easier?

Most of large companies suffer inertia, even if they have big teams and large amount of cash. Most people in companies do not want to take much risk. Starting anything new or completely changing the way something has been done until now is often complicated or even impossible.

Focus on solving problems that other companies are bad at doing

Find a service online done by a company that you think sucks. Build a better version and go to talk to them about partnering with your or even aquire your company. You might think they will just copy what you did. Believe me, many companies are not short of ideas, they are short of the ability to implement and execute ideas. Everything takes ages and is often done by people who were not very passioned about what they are doing. If you build something better, it clearly has value.

During your day, I am sure you use a lot of services thinking they could be much better, more user friendly.

### Be clear about your audience

Be super specific here. It should be as niche as possible and identified. Ex: UX designers in 50-250 companies in eCommerce. It might sound specifying too much, however it’s much better focus on a niche first and speak to this audience. As the saying goes: “A product for everyone is a product for no one”.

So, who are solving a problem for? Is your audience aware of the problem? (Many times, people have a problem but are not aware of it, they done something in a certain way up until now and they were fine with it. Are they ready to pay to fix this problem? Are they aware of the problem? How much? 

One of the greatest book about this is “The brain audit”. This book explains why you should always be very specific when addressing your audience and what problem are you solving and how you are different from the competition.

A great tagline would be “We help women over 50 to start & practice yoga”. Now if you were 55, never did yoga in your life before and had choice between these 2 companies: One advertising “Yoga for everyone” or another one with the above tagline, which one would you choose? 

Being very clear about what you do is often underrated. I see so many companies and even after 10 minutes on the website, I still can’t figure out what problem they solve. It’s probably OK if you are Adobe or IBM. However, until you reach the same size, please use simple words like you would explain your grandma what your service is about. I am not joking.

Competition? That’s a great sign! No competition is a red flag.

### Storytelling

Our brains were made for stories, not facts.

That’s probably why you remember your childhood stories and not the facts you learned in class. The problem is, when we enter the adult world, it feels all to natural to become more rigid and factual, especially when entering a formal work setting.

### Negociation

We all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers and employers, among others. Negotiation is also the key to business success. No business can survive without profitable contracts. Within a company, negotiation skills can lead to your career advancement.

I hope that you will join the hundreds of thousands of learners who have made “Successful Negotiation” one of the most popular and highly-rated MOOCs worldwide.  In the course, you’ll learn about and practice the four steps to a successful negotiation:

### Bootstrapping vs. Funding

Bootstrapping is gaining momentum lately and I am quite happy about it. While not all companies can be bootstrapped, bootstrapping means making your company take off without external funding. Most people would work on their project as a side project or even leave their work, move in a remote/rural area with a very low cost of living, and focus on building something themselves or with a small team. The idea is similar to indie bands of music. 

The great thing about bootstrapping is that the discipline forces you to be time bound, focus on product / market fit as early as possible, go to talk with many possible customers as soon as possible. Time and money pressure create a real force and sense of economic reality. Frugality with money forces us to be more creative and do more with less. I personally feel this invigorating. 

Raising money has also clear advantage, one being buying speed of execution. You can hire more people, professional sales people earlier, etc. My only advice would be: If you raise money, make sure you raise money from people you share the same values with. Everyone can be nice when the sky is blue and birds singing. When things go south, great investors will be by your side to help, the wrong ones will make your life even more miserable.

Remember: There is no such thing as free money.

### Misconception: You need a killer idea

This is overrated. Sometimes we are looking for the next big idea. Actually, small increments are often the best bets. Everything Instagram did, could be done on Facebook. Everything that you could do on Facebook, you could do on Myspace. The question is never "what" but "how". Something that is just a little bit better, faster, easier, nicer can make it. This is even more the case in B2B software. Most the B2B software actually sucks I think. There is a huge room for improvement, always.

### Marketing for founders (Indie Hackers)

I've been doing marketing for four years, and have learned a lot (particularly while building our bootstrap startup, **[MakerBox](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdul8q8zr8h7h7vlp80sl/g3hnh5he44zerkir/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFrZXJib3guY2x1Yi8=)**). Read on for 12 marketing rules to help you craft your next campaign!

### **1. Nobody wants to book a meeting with you**

Users want to try your product or download something for free, not spend time talking to a stranger.

Your landing page conversion rate will skyrocket with the right call-to-action, and usually "book a meeting" is not the best CTA. This is especially true if you're targeting millennials or Gen Z.

### **2. Higher price = better customers**

Being cheap is the worst differentiator from your competitors. Cheap products attract customers who only care about the price. They will leave you as soon they see a cheaper alternative.

Instead, provide unique value at an above average price point. You will get customers who appreciate your product and understand its value.

Increase your pricing. You'll thank me later!

### **3. Empower users**

Nobody likes to be marketed to. Do you enjoy seeing a fake discount countdown or getting bombarded with emails about the same thing? No. You don't. Your users don't like it, either.

Guess what they do like? Getting free educational resources, feeling empowered to achieve their goals, or having a good laugh. Try these approaches instead!

### **4. Talking to customers is a shortcut to success**

You have brilliant marketing ideas, but your customers may have better ones.

Conduct buyer interviews with your customers, and get inspiration from them. Learn why they bought your product, what is important to them, and what they enjoy the most. This can be your next marketing campaign.

### **5. Having an email list is a superpower**

Algorithms change, but having an acquisition channel that you actually control is a superpower. You can market it whenever you want, and predict how much revenue you will generate.

If you're not building an email list, you're in danger.

### **6. There is no such thing as too much social proof**

People trust people. If someone with similar needs and interests as I have benefited from this product, I should check it out.

Do you already have testimonials? Great! Now, add case studies, user statistics, press mentions, product awards, reviews from opinion leaders, and interviews with a founder.

You can always add more social proof.

### **7. Showing the product > describing the product**

Some founders write five paragraphs about their features, and they lose customers because of it.

Showing a stunning product GIF is way more convincing than describing it, even if you are a world-class copywriter.

People love visuals. Give them interesting things to look at.

### **8. Nail one acquisition channel before adding another**

Trying to be everywhere likely means failing everywhere.

Instead, pick one acquisition channel and master it. Learn what's working and what's not. Optimize your marketing campaign, then move on to the next channel.

One step at a time.

### **9. Sell positive futures, not product features**

Nobody cares about your features and integrations. People only care about the results that they can achieve with your product. You are selling a positive future, not five brilliant features.

Still, don't forget to mention features to clarify how you will provide the promised value.

### **10. Your customers are the best promoters**

Again, people trust people. If your friend recommends a product, you'll check it out because you trust their judgment.

Nudge your customers to recommend you on social media. Sometimes, it only takes one email to skyrocket your referral traffic.

Your customers would love to help you, but only if you ask them.

### **11. Distribution is as important as the content**

An excellent article with 100 views is worse than an okay article with 50K views.

You should spend as much time on distribution as you do creating. This goes for your product, articles, TikTok, newsletter, etc.

### **12. Paying customers is the true validation**

No matter how many people said that they like your product, or how long your waitlist is, you should only care about paying customers.

This is the ultimate validation for marketing campaigns, product ideas, and offer experiments.

Focus on getting paid, not upvoted.

### STICKINESS TEST

✅ Think of distribution channel : How do I sell this? To who? Is this a pain they feel? Do they have the budget for this?

✅ Is the product sticky? Once it's been installed, is it painful to remove it? (ex: alerting tools, data source, etc.)

✅ Is this a crowded space? If yes, is there a way to find a niche in this space? (ex: only for hotel chains or "video first") or feedback oriented (Userleap)

✅ Find a niche: Shopify only (even if the tech product can cover many more things) working a niche will make your message resonate better. 

✅ Fit to an existing ecosystem : Ex Shopify or iOS apps
