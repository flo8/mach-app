### Resting you CNS alias the central nervous system

Learning something new is tiring on the brain. It’s good to recognize it and not think it’s because it’s you. This is the same for everyone learning something new. Our central nervous system requires time to adapt to something new. When you learn to drive a car, your central nervous system is solicited in great length and would make you feel tired just after an hour of drive. This is because you are still not used to it. Beginners can’t even talk while they’re driving. For people who are used to drive everyday, they can actually talk or think while driving. This is the same for learning to play an instrument, drive or train a new sport.

So what does it mean for you? First it’s important to recognize this effect and not think this is not for you. It’s the same for everyone.

Now, how can you workaround this? My advice here is to acknowledge this and try to include mild exercise, meditation, yoga, deep breathing, even nature walks in your day. Box (or square breathing) is a technique that is very effective and simple to put in practice.

Last but not least, don’t underestimate the power of rest. Our brains memorize and need sleep to function at their best. Sleep deprivation is one of the worst thing you can do to your productivity (and your health). Sleep is so underrated these days.

The amount of study that confirms it is immense and leaves no doubt: Lack of sleep deteriorates our ability to concentrate, learn and even communicate. Memory lapses increase. Problem-solving abilities decline. And yes, our CNS can’t recover properly which makes us more prone to stress.

### Conclusion

Unlike what some popular belief, sleep is not a waste of time, it’s actually the opposite, it’s always a good investment of your time. It pays on the long term.
