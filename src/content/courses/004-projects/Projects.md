## Instructions on projects and how to approach them

### How do I start and finish a large project?

First and foremost: **get a full, comprehensive understanding of the problem**.

Often, **[Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)** helps with this step. Explaining a problem or concept to someone (or something) that has zero knowledge or understanding helps to gain a deeper insight into the problem. By doing so, one has to think a lot more about the problem which will lead to a deeper understanding.

Second: **Don't go straight to the computer!**

Spend considerable time pondering about the problem/task. Create some sketches, drawings, some pseudocode, some plain language hints, whatever may help **on paper** (I'm emphasizing this here because digital tools are distractions from the actual task at hand - use only pencil & paper or a whiteboard.) Analyse the problem thoroughly.

This leads us to the following.

Remember one thing when tackling big projects by yourself:

> Everything in the world is made of smaller parts.
> 

This means that basically whatever big machine, house, skyscraper, car, train, computer, etc. you look at consists of many smaller structures that, combined, make the final product. The smaller structures consist of smaller structures and so on.

The same applies to big programs. They consist of many smaller units that are coupled together to form the whole. Ideally (but often not possible) each smaller unit should work (and be tested) independently from the others.

Start small. Look at the problem you have chosen and try to break it down into smaller parts. Rinse and repeat until you think that you can't break it apart any further.

Once you have reached that point, start programming. Build one small part, test it. Build the next small part, test it, and so on.

Don't look at the final, big picture as this will overwhelm you. Tackle one individual part at a time.

The biggest problem inexperienced programmers face is that mostly they get overwhelmed when they look at a large task. But this problem is not too difficult to overcome:

Don't try to see the final program with all bells and whistles. Focus on a small, manageable part, complete it, and move on. Even the most complex program/system consists of small, simple parts.

### Let’s create our first backend

Our first backend (based on this video) : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYO60-qYOI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYO60-qYOI)

Do you know what is an IP address / port?
