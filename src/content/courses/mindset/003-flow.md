### Mastering focus and attention

A very smart guy once wrote the following formula to define knowledge.

$**`Knowledge ∝ (Attention x time)`**$

How to read this? It means that the knowledge we accumulate, is simply the result of our level of attention, multiplied by time spent.

‎In other words, to assimilate or produce knowledge on a given subject, it is necessary to spend time quantitatively on the subject, but also qualitatively devote a high level of attention to it.‎

If you spent a huge amount of hours to study a topic while checking your smartphone every 5 minutes, the accumulated knowledge might be poor even if you spent a lot of time on it.

‎The one who controls her attention has a huge advantage over the rest of the population: she has more time (because she spends less time on the Internet), she learns better and more effectively, she advances his own projects and objectives in life with more serenity. Mastering attention is simply the most important skill in our knowledge society, because there is no knowledge possible without attention.‎

‎If there is no miracle recipe to control our attention, we can nevertheless propose some tracks:‎

‎Be disciplined and work on your habits. For example, this may consist of forcing yourself to cut off the notifications on your Smartphone when working on an important task. Or, define time slots without distractions during the day.‎

‎Learn to manage your attention. As Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman showed in his book [‎‎Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Kahneman/dp/0374533555), maintaining‎‎ one's attention requires effort; attention is a limited resource over the course of a day. It is a question of focusing thoroughly on the most important work of the day and knowing how to alternate the moments when the attention will have to be very focused and the moments when the attention can be more diffuse.‎

‎Attention is also like a muscle: the more you work on it, the more it gets stronger. Meditation exercises strengthen our attention capital. But above all, we strengthen our attention capital by a healthy lifestyle, starting with the quality of our sleep.‎

### Your time is limited, so how to get the most of it?

Despite what many people want to believe, human beings are not good at multi-tasking. What we can become good at is automaticity, which is the ability to do something routine in the background while doing something else. Most of us can talk while chopping onions, or drink coffee while reading; with practice, we can also take notes while listening, but we can’t study effectively, program, or do other mentally challenging tasks while paying attention to something else—we only think we can.

The point of organizing and preparing is to get into the most productive mental state possible. Psychologists call it flow; athletes call it “being in the zone,” and musicians talk about losing themselves in what they’re playing. Whatever name you use, people produce much more per unit of time in this state than normal. The bad news is that it takes roughly 15 minutes to get back into a state of flow after an interruption, no matter how short the interruption was. This means that if you are interrupted half a dozen times per hour, you are never at your productive peak.

**True story**

In his 1961 short story “Harrison Bergeron,” Kurt Vonnegut described a future in which everyone is forced to be equal. Good-looking people have to wear masks, athletic people have to wear weights—and intelligent people are forced to carry around radios that interrupt their thoughts at random intervals. I sometimes wonder if—oh, hang on, just got a notification on my phone —sorry, what were we talking about?

### Consistency is key

Consistency beats everything. Consistency is one of the strongest force in this world. Just like sports or music, 10 hours of practice at once at random interval is much less efficient than 2 hours per day at a consistent rate.

Just try to go to a gym and lift weight for 10 hours and then do nothing for a week. Repeat this during a year. In the best case, you will have no results, in the worst case you will just get yourself injured. The same goes for learning. So if the brain is like a muscle, we should train it as is.

It’s therefore important to set realistic expectations you know you can hold over the long term. Don’t overcommit, 1 hour per day is already great, 2 hours per day is amazing if it can be kept on the long term.

**This quote sums it up quite well:**

_"We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day, and underestimate what we can do in a year."_

And an alternate version that is often seen:

_“Most people overestimate what they can achieve in a year and underestimate what they can achieve in ten years.”_

Point is, we overestimate short term and are bad at estimating the power of long term.

Motivation is so overrated these days. Just like anyone who shows up in the gym every morning for years or decades, do you believe they rely on motivation when it’s cold outside and they feel like staying in bed watching Youtube? Absolutely not. Discipline and consistency are the main driving forces here.

Motivation alone can’t bring people on the Olympics podium. Discipline and consistency do. Again, motivation is a mirage, an illusion far from reality.

Want to see it proof with your own eyes? Go to a gym in January, it’s usually crowded with people who subscribed as “New year’s resolution”, often after eating a bit too much during Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Now go again three months later when it’s cold and snowing, only very few people. They are the subscriber who relied on motivation. They also failed to see quick results (obviously this takes time) and motivation went down, one day, motivation is not sufficient to get them to the gym, end of the story.

All the gyms know this and even have their business model rely on this phenomenon.

Now ask people who are in great shape around you, how long have they been training for? What do they think about motivation? I bet no one comes out of motivation alone. They come because they are disciplined and consistent. Period.

Steven Kotler sums it up best: _“Motivation is what gets us into the game. Learning allows us to continue to play. Creativity is how we steer. Flow is optimal performance, how we amplify all the results beyond all reasonable expectation.”_

Keep things simple. Two hours per day works best but one hour is great too. Use morning time if possible, when you have less distraction and your focus is at its best.

### **How can I get/stay motivated to learn programming?**

Often we think "if I were motivated enough... then I could...," however; it is action that drives motivation. First comes action, then motivation. Find small, specific programs to create that seem fun and entertaining to you.

Get rid of the distractions. Go offline from time to time. Motivation is not something that comes by chance, it’s usually the result of the will to take action and then enjoying it more and more.

Discipline will take you to places that motivation alone can’t.

### Goal setting

A study from Coursera showed that learners who set a goal are 75% more likely to complete a given course.

Setting a goal is much simpler than you think. Just plan ahead moments in your week when you know you will be able to turn off all distractions. The key here is to have realistic expectations, start small first. A common error is to overestimate what you can do and set realistic goals. Better small goals you can accomplish than bigger goals that won’t be sustainable. Again, think long term and remember consistency is key.

Setting a specific hour and day always works better than flexible hours. Flexible hours let us postpone our sessions as life gets busy. On the other hand, if you set specific time to start and end, it will strengthen your commitment. Think of these goals as if you would meet with someone would be waiting for you at a specific hour. Obviously, you don’t want to be late and have the other person wait. Think of this goal the same way, you have a meeting with yourself.

Remember, it's better to keep improve yourself by 1% everyday over the next year than overdo it over a short period of time. This is true for anything we practice or learn, wether it's sport, nutrition or learning a language, nothing beats long term thinking + constant progress.

Time is your most precious asset. It should be respected and leveraged to its fullest potential.

Treat time as the ultimate currency—it’s all you have and you’ll never get it back.
