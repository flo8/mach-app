Being able to organize thoughts is a powerful tool. To make my point here, I would like to give you a quick example that will illustrate my point.

Look at figure below for 10 seconds, then look away and try to write out your phone number with these symbols (Use a space for ’0’.) When you are finished, continue to read below.

Did you succeed? Difficult isn’t it? Unless you have a very good visual memory, it’s quite hard.

Now look at the representation below, these are actually the exact same patterns. They are now just structured in a more logical and visual way for your brain to organize and remember.

Now try to do the same exercise again. Do you see how much easier are the symbols to remember when the pattern is made explicit?

This example was just to give you an example that the brain works better when it can make sense of a model. Remembering things that do not make sense is more complicated and less effective.

In our courses, we will try to organize learnings so things do make sense using concepts you already learnt and that you can connect together.
