How can this be free? üéÅ

#description
This website was started as a website made with love and passion for software engineering and sharing knowledge. As a result, we do not expect any income for now and want to keep things simple.

We might welcome donations from companies in the future. Companies are paying absurd sums of money to hire people. Many tech recruiters are charging companies between 30% to 40% of yearly income of the hired person. For tech talent, this means very large sums of money. We believe these should be used to feed into an ecosystem and benefit the candidates.

A completely different model that benefits you first

#description
Companies are ready to pay a lot of money on hiring agencies to hire talented people and even to relocate them sometimes. This money would be better spent training people.

**We believe this money should go to create better education. In any case, we will never charge people for taking the opportunity to learn.**

  Make mutual help the standard

  #description
  Explaining a concept you recently learnt to someone else is magic as it benefits both the teacher and the learner. We aim to create an ecosystem where everyone can be taught from more experienced students while teaching students with less experience. A virtuous cycle.
