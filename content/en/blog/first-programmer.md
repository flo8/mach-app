Believe it or not, the first thing most resembling a computer program predates the invention of the computer! Back in the 19th century, Ada Lovelace, a noble Englishwoman with a thing for mathematics, decided to translate the work of Charles Babbage about the analytic machine, a proto-calculator. Happy with the quality of her own work, she added several annexes to the original document that ended up three times bigger than it was prior to its translation. The last one, the G annex, includes the first algorithm that can calculate the Bernoulli Numbers. It was 1843. Ada Lovelace became the first programmer in history.
