People want to create thing and have fun. We learn best by playing and having fun.

The traditional model to learn is to learn first, put to practice later: Learn->Do
We actually learn best this way: Do—>Learn—>Do.

This is why this website and course will teach you how to build things from scratch. We will give you exercises and sample projects, however, it’s even better if you start using your knowledge to build the app you always wanted to use. Think of apps that you are currently using. I am sure there are apps that you wish had a specific feature or were simpler or easier to use.

Having a project is usually the best way to put your knowledge into practice.

If you like games, build one. If you like make up, build a great app to rate/find great makeup products. If you like food, create your own app to find restaurants.

Even if many apps already exist in each category, there’s always room for improvement or catering to a specific type of users.

For example, instead to build another restaurant location app, you could create an app for finding/rating the best ramen shops. Focusing on a smaller group mean you can do and make features that would be harder or more complicated for general restaurants.

Building something you want is a very empowering feeling and gives meaning to your journey of learning.

If you are not motivated to build something, that’s totally OK. Just imagine how your life will become different after many new opportunities will arise. The ability to work on projects you like. The ability to work from remote places while earning a good salary. The ability to take control of your future by having the choice of the company you want to work for.

Having a goal in mind and visualizing it, is a very empowering force, use it.

You’ll always learn more in the trenches than from any classroom, book, or course.
