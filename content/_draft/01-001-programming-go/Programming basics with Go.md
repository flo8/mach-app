# Programming basics with Go

### What is software engineering about?

What is a problem? It’s a sum of smaller problems, which are in turn, a sum of smaller problems.

Programming comes down to ability to do one thing: break any problem into smaller problems

How to solve problems: A problem well defined is a problem half solved.

Break it down and work the problem.

Polya’s problem solving technique

Computers are built like this: small components that can perform very basic operations at the bottom

### Need to learn grammar, it’s like music!

This is a bit like practicing scales when trying to learn piano. It doesn't matter how artistic you think you are, you are unlikely to write good music without understanding the fundamentals and practicing the mechanics.

What’s a source code? It’s just a file with readable text :)

Analogy with music partition instead of notes, it is instructions for processor, ex:

Some programming languages execute this as text (scripts)
Other languages compile your text into a binary form (faster)

Structure of a Go program

Hello world

Why create functions or types?
DRY principle
KISS principle
