# Data structures for storage and retrieval

### Intro

This is probably one the most important chapter.

When it comes to designing data structures or algorithms, paper and pen can go a long way. Visualization is important and sometimes it’s tempting to fire up the IDE to start coding something. Please don’t. Take time with paper and pen. Even the most experienced software engineers usually do this. A problem well defined and understood is a half solved problem. I still often see people trying to solve coding challenges that they even don’t fully understand. They try to throw a bunch of random code at it and hope for the best. Just don’t.

“**If I only had an hour to chop down a tree, I would spend the first 45 minutes sharpening my axe.” - Abraham Lincoln.**

This also applies to any problem we are facing in software engineering. Sharpening your axe is usualyl best done with music in your ears, phone off, with a blank page and a pen. Once you get a clear understanding of the problem and have a solution. Then code.

An in-depth look at how data structures such as B-trees, log-structured merge trees, and Bloom filters are used in production systems such as Postgres, LevelDB, and Redis.

Hashing (example for password storage)

Sorting

Bloom filters

Recursivity (inception - tree walking or sorting example)

Data structures: Hashmaps, Slices, Pointers, etc.

Types of exercise: Write a Bloom filter, write a Skip list, design a file format for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value data.

### Algorithms

writing code is like ablity to get sound from

an instrument

algo is what make sound beautiful

get offline with paper and pen

take time to think before you write

ask 100 persons to write code and you will get 100 different codes, thats why it’s not uncommon to hear code is like art

you can emphasize on writing a code that is easy to understand, speed of execution, etc.

there’s a lot of personality that can be understood from someones code

10x programmer

they do exist, I saw people solving problems in hours with beautiful solutions while it took others weeks to get something that was slow

are they smarter? No, it’s actually random people, they just have a way to make something complicated to be simple

as da vinci said: ultimate perfection is when nothing can be removed

many programmers tend to write too much unnecessary code

it feels the more code they write, the better

It’s actually the opposite, when working on a product in teams, code is always best kept short, simple and easy to read
