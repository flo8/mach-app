# How to translate content

## Markdown files

The markdown files are located in the `content` folder. There is already the English translations in the `en` folder. If you want to translate to another language, create the file with the same hierarchy and change the lang folder.

Example: if you want to translate `content/en/home.md` in french, create the file and its content in `content/fr/home.md`

## Structural wording

The translation for menus, form, etc. are located in the `locales` folder.
